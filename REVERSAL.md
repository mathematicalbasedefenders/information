# Mathematical Base Defenders: Reversal Update

**IMPORTANT: Mechanics in this page may NOT be final.**

After over a year, I have finally come to the realization that how Mathematical Base Defenders is played (<`0.3.0-beta`) is pretty... complicated. So, that is why, I have decided to plan an update after a 10-1 vote (among my friends as of 2023-01-20 15:00 UTC) saying that I should create a new "gameplay flow" from scratch. That is, Mathematical Base Defenders will have an entirely new gameplay mechanic, possibly replacing the old one.

## The New Gameplay: Differences

Instead of trying to be different and "cool" by making this math game make you form problems instead of solving expressions/equations, it will just be solving expressions and equations, just like every other math game.

Other notable gameplay changes include:
- Enemies move vertically instead of horizontally.
- Tiles will be removed. Instead, players are free to put in any valid input they want.
- There will (probably) now may be only one correct answer per enemy, because it wants you to solve an equation, not make you create an equation that satisifes certain criteria.

## The New Gameplay: Similarities

You will still be "defending your base from enemies", hence the name.

Other notable gameplay similarites include:
- Bonuses for "stunts", such as comboing, killing multiple enemies at once.
- In multiplayer modes, enemies will still be "sent" for doing "stunts".
- It is still based off of speed.

## What will happen?

When the Reversal Update is released, these things MAY happen:
- Leaderboards are reset. (Note: I still haven't decided whether to archive the old leaderboards.)
- Levels are reset.
- Win rate is reset.

Other non-gameplay-related statistics, such as rank and join date, will be kept.

## When will it be released?

Probably around 2023-02 to 2023-03. These new features take time to design and work out.

However, if you're impatient (like me), you can check the `reversal` branch on the [repository](https://github.com/mathematicalbasedefenders/play.mathematicalbasedefenders.com)

## Why do this?

There are many reasons that led me to this decision. The main reason is that the game is inaccessible and too hard to play, as pointed out by some of the playerbase. Another reason is that the source code is extremely poorly written, because that's what happens 1 year ago. Files containing 1000 lines, functions being 300 lines and doing multiple things make me look stupid, just like technical debt.

I want to "refresh" the game, while adopting more best security and privacy practices along with it as well. I also have plans to rewrite the game content to be in TypeScript, as well as making it easier to selfhost if you want to.

I believe this would also make the game more easy to play, therefore attracting more players, as I want this game to be one of those "easy to learn, hard to master" games or something like that. I also want this game to be "accessible" (where you don't have to learn any complicated rules) and non-grindy.

## FAQ

### Can I still play Mathematical Base Defenders during the development process?
Yes. It will only go down when an update comes.

### Will it still be open-source?
Probably yes.

### What if I want to join the development/moderation team?
I am currently not accepting applications for the moderation team. However, contributions to the repository are welcome. If you do happen to contribute, you may be considered for a position on the team. You can also donate.

### When the update comes, how long will the server be down for?
Probably around an hour. (but obviously more because im stupid an incompetent)
