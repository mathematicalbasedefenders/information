You can now [reset your password](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/forgot-password).

Instead of needing to know the user number to find information about a user, you can now find information about a user with just their username.

(i.e. Instead of having to do
[https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?number=1](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?number=1), you can now do [https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?username=mistertfy64](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?username=mistertfy64))
