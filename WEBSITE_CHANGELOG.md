## 0.6.0
2024-11-14

### Changes:
- Front page has changed, now includes a preview clip of gameplay and many other things.
- Leaderboards page has its layout changed. Additionally, username on leaderboards are also colorized according to player rank.
- User profile page has its layout changed. 
- Changed the website's font from `Computer Modern Unicode Serif` to `Noto Sans`.
- New registrants no longer get the `Tester` rank (as it has already been long enough since release).
- Numbers with the whole part having more than 3 digits now have commas and now follow the `en-US` locale string conventions.
- Time since event is now shown in "relative form" (e.g., `3 minutes ago`) instead of a timestamp.
- Transactional e-mails are now sent in plain text.
- Added more helpful messages instead of just `Invalid Request` if an API query can't be found or is invalid.
- Removed the "slide-down" banners in favor of the JavaScript `alert()` modal.
- Register page doesn't redirect back to index page if info is invalid or on an internal server error.

These are just some of the many changes that is now in Website version `0.6.0`. And of course, things will break because I can't be bothered to test them throughly. But if something does break, mind helping me by [filing an issue](https://github.com/mathematicalbasedefenders/mathematicalbasedefenders.com/issues/new)?

You can now [reset your password](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/forgot-password).

Instead of needing to know the user number to find information about a user, you can now find information about a user with just their username.

(i.e. Instead of having to do
[https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?number=1](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?number=1), you can now do [https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?username=mistertfy64](https://mathematicalbasedefenders.com/users?username=mistertfy64))

The former method still works.
